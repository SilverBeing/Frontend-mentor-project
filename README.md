## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Javascript


### What I learned
I learned alot working on the project. As a self taught programmer working on a responsive website with a responsive navigation bar was a bit difficult but i look forward to learning more.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@media only screen and (min-width:768px){
  .....
}
```
```js
const burgerIcon = () =>{
    const openIcon = document.querySelector(".home-menu");
    const closeIcon = document.querySelector(".close-menu");
    ......
}

```


### Continued development
A area i would be focusing on is building a responsice website the correct way



### Useful resources
- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - This website was very helpful to me as it helped me figure a way i could work with the navigation bar responsiveness.
